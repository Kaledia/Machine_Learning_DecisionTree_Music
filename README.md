# Machine_Learning_DecisionTree_Music
Using the Machine Learning Decision Tree Model on imaginary data to predict the kind of music people would like based on age and gender.
The model DecisionTreeClassifier from python library scikit-learn was used. The label is music genre and the features are age and gender. The model was trained and tested with a test-size of 0.2, the relative good score of 0.75 proved that the Decision Tree Classifier is a good model to make this prediction. The Decision Tree Graph was generated.
